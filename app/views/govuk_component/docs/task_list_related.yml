name: Task list related links
description: Links to task lists that a page is part of
body: |
  The component is designed to go on a content page to accompany a small task list in a sidebar. It provides links to the main task list page.

  The component has two uses:

  - above the task list, it provides a link to the main task list page
  - below the task list, it shows and links to any other task lists that this page belongs to

  In the first use case, only one link should be present and the entire text of the component should be contained in a heading. In the second use case, if more than one link is provided, the links should be shown in a list, separate from the heading.
