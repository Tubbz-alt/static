name: "Button"
description: "Use buttons to move though a transaction, aim to use only one button per page."
body: |
  Button text should be short and describe the action the button performs.

  GOV.UK Elements has more information on how buttons should be used https://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/buttons/

  Note: We do not consume GOV.UK Elements directly due to the naming conventions being leaky,
  in time this component will be a wrapper for the [GOV.UK Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend) project's button component.

  Global button styles seen at `app/assets/stylesheets/helpers/_buttons.scss`
  should be considered deprecated with this component replacing any instances.

  govuk-* namespace replaced with pub-c-* otherwise we will conflict with https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/blob/master/docs/components.m
