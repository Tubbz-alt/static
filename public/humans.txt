GOV.UK is built by a team at the Government Digital Service (with thanks to Martha!) in London,
Bristol and Manchester.  If you'd like to join us, see https://gdscareers.gov.uk/

Today we're saying goodbye to a senior product manager, Mark McLeod. Mark joined GDS in 2012
as a policy advisor, and later became a product manager in the early stages of GOV.UK.

Mark has worked on many things, including search, email notifications and retiring Local
Directgov. He's been instrumental in giving GOV.UK publishers access to data about their
content, so that they can make more informed decisions.

Anyone who's worked with Mark knows he always throws himself wholeheartedly into the work and
really cares about making a difference. He's been a huge user needs champion, helping us stick
to our principles, building products based on evidence.
