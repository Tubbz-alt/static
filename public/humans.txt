GOV.UK is built by a team at the Government Digital Service (with thanks to Martha!) in London,
Bristol and Manchester.  If you'd like to join us, see https://jobs.jobvite.com/gds

Just for today we’d like to use www.gov.uk/humans.txt to say goodbye to Issy
Long - one of GDS’ longest serving engineers.

Issy joined GDS in 2014, and helped us smoothly deal with the fallout of
transitioning hundreds of separate websites onto the single GOV.UK domain.

Over the last six years they’ve never been afraid to do the hard work that
makes working on GOV.UK great. Our applications, our developer tools, our
documentation - in thousands of pull requests, Issy has made everything better.

Issy - thank you for all your hard work. GDS won’t be the same without you, but
we’re looking forward to seeing all your future successes. Keep being amazing!
